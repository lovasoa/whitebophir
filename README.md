# WBO

WBO is an online collaborative whiteboard that allows many users to draw simultaneously on a large virtual board.
The board is updated in real time for all connected users, and its state is always persisted. It can be used for many different purposes, including art, entertainment, design, teaching.

A demonstration server is available at [wbo.ophir.dev](https://wbo.ophir.dev)

## Running your own instance of WBO

If you have your own web server, and want to run a private instance of WBO on it, you can. It should be very easy to get it running on your own server.

### Running the code in a container (safer)

If you use the [docker](https://www.docker.com/) containerization service, you can easily run WBO as a container. 
An official docker image for WBO is hosted on dockerhub as [`lovasoa/wbo`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lovasoa/wbo).

You can run it with the following command :

```
docker run -it --publish 5001:80 --volume $(pwd)/wbo-boards:/opt/app/server-data lovasoa/wbo:latest
```

This will run WBO :
 - on port 5001
 - persisting the user data in `$(pwd)/wbo-boards`

You can then access WBO at `http://localhost:5001`.

### Running the code without a container

Alternatively, you can run the code with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) directly, without docker.

First, download the sources:
```
git clone git@github.com:lovasoa/whitebophir.git
cd whitebophir
```

Then [install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v10.0 or superior)
if you don't have it already, then install WBO's dependencies:

```
npm install --production
```

Finally, you can start the server:
```
PORT=5001 npm start
```

This will run WBO directly on your machine, on port 5001, without any isolation from the other services.

### Running WBO on a subfolder

By default, WBO launches his own web server and serves all of its content at the root of the server (on `/`).
If you want to make the server accessible with a different path like `https://your.domain.com/wbo/` you have to setup a reverse proxy.
See instructions on our Wiki about [how to setup a reverse proxy for WBO](https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir/wiki/Setup-behind-Reverse-Proxies).

## Troubleshooting
