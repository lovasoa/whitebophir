# 654wak654 Fork
Hi. This is a fork of the original project. It adds couple of small features (2 new tools and minio support). They are described briefly at the bottom of this README.

# WBO

WBO is an online collaborative whiteboard that allows many users to draw simultaneously on a large virtual board.
The board is updated in real time for all connected users, and its state is always persisted. It can be used for many different purposes, including art, entertainment, design, teaching.

A demonstration server is available at [wbo.ophir.dev](https://wbo.ophir.dev).

## Running your own instance of WBO

If you have your own web server, and want to run a private instance of WBO on it, you can.

#### Clone the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:lovasoa/whitebophir.git
cd whitebophir
```

### Running the code in a container (safer)
[![docker image status](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/lovasoa/wbo)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lovasoa/wbo)

You can run the [official docker image hosted on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lovasoa/wbo) or build your own very easily using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

#### Choose where to persist the data

At the moment, WBO has a very simple persistance model: it saves each whiteboard as a separate json file in a directory.

You can edit `docker-compose.yml` to choose where you want to persist the data :

```yml
    volumes:
      - ./server-data:/opt/app/server-data
```

Here, I chose to persist the data in `./server-data` (inside the directory where I cloned the repo).

#### Start the service

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

This will start wbo on port 80. (You can change the port number in `docker-compose.yaml` if you want).


### Running the code without a container

Alternatively, you can run the code with [node](https://nodejs.org/) directly, without docker : 

```
npm install
npm start
```

If you do that, the code is running directly on your machine, without any isolation from the other services. Make sure you do not run another sensitive service on the same host.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience an issue or want to propose a new feature in WBO, please [open a github issue](https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir/issues/new).


### Additional Features
#### Two new tools:
- Background (Shortcut: `b`): Allows you to upload an image for the background of the canvas. 
- Pointer (Shortcut: `f`): Allows users to point at things for others to see.

#### Minio suport:
- Instead of writing to the filesystem, the server now saves boards to a minio instance. The configuration is inside  [server/minio.js](server/minio.js).
